# Documenting: Learning the Gujarati language (and the Elixir programming language)

# Day 1

I believe the best way to learn Gujarati is through reading books and conversing with native speakers. I've decided to start with [this book](https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=A59C1369119EC9B919A83FFB52016666). I don't know how good or bad this book is, but I will leave a review once I finish reading it.

For Elixir, there's a [dedicated page](https://elixir-lang.org/learning.html) on their website that provides various learning resources. I will start with the first book on the page, [Elixir in Action](https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=2BDD3BB8C63102C229A207607788F480). I will leave a review on that too once I'm done.

16 pages in, this book sucks. Switching to [this](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Books/Linguistics/Mega%20linguistics%20pack/Indo-European/Indo-Aryan/Gujarati%2C%20Teach%20Yourself%20%28Dwyer%29.pdf).
