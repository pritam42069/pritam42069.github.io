# Book Review: Six Easy Pieces

**Author:** Richard P. Feynman

**Topics:** Physics

**Length:** 176 pages


> *One of the men who discovered this was out with his girlfriend the night after he realized that nuclear reactions must be going on in the stars in order to make them shine. She said, “Look at how pretty the stars shine!” He said, “Yes, and right now I am the only man in the world who knows why they shine.” She merely laughed at him. She was not impressed with being out with the only man who, at that moment, knew why stars shine. Well, it is sad to be alone, but that is the way it is in this world.*

## Summary

[*Six Easy Pieces*](https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=FE6910526003C503D504FB2D56993985) is a collection of six chapters from Richard Feynman's [*Lectures on Physics*](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/). 

The original book by Feynman is based on a course he gave to undergraduates and postgraduates at the California Institute of Technology. However, these transcripts can be challenging for those without a science background to understand. As a result, the book Six Easy Pieces was created, featuring six chapters curated from the original text that do not require any prior knowledge.

This is true for the first five chapters; however, the sixth chapter, "Quantum Behavior," is a tough nut to crack without any background knowledge. I had already studied quantum physics in school, yet I found this chapter challenging to understand, even though it was meant to be accessible to beginners in physics.

## Pros

- **Engaging Introduction to Science:** The first five chapters effectively introduce scientific concepts in an engaging manner, making them accessible to beginners.
- **Clear and Approachable Language:** The book uses clear language throughout, ensuring that readers can easily grasp complex ideas without difficulty.
- **Concise and Manageable:** It's a short read, which makes it convenient for readers looking to explore fundamental scientific principles without committing to a lengthy book.
- **Fascinating Insights into Astronomy:** The astronomy section within the chapter Relation Of Physics To Other Sciences provides captivating insights that deepen understanding across scientific disciplines.

## Cons
- **Limited Pedagogical Value:** While informative, the book isn't designed primarily for formal education purposes in schools or as a comprehensive introduction to science for students.
- **Fragmented Content Selection:** Because it selects specific chapters from the original text, there are occasional gaps that may leave readers wanting more context or continuity between topics.
